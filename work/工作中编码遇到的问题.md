#  开发中遇到的（朋友问的）

## System.currentTimeMillis及nanoTime

jdk 中的延迟队列，任务实现 Delay 接口，然后计算时间，用的 nanoTime（纳秒），nanoTime 并不是 currentTime 的 1000 倍，无法实现延时任务的功能。

```java
// nanoTime 文档注释如下：
/**
 * Returns the current value of the running Java Virtual Machine's
 * high-resolution time source, in nanoseconds.
 *
 * This method can only be used to measure elapsed time and is
 * not related to any other notion of system or wall-clock time.
 * The value returned represents nanoseconds since some fixed but
 * arbitrary <i>origin</i> time (perhaps in the future, so values
 * may be negative).  The same origin is used by all invocations of
 * this method in an instance of a Java virtual machine; other
 * virtual machine instances are likely to use a different origin.
 *
 * <p>This method provides nanosecond precision, but not necessarily
 * nanosecond resolution (that is, how frequently the value changes)
 * - no guarantees are made except that the resolution is at least as
 * good as that of {@link #currentTimeMillis()}.
 *
 * <p>Differences in successive calls that span greater than
 * approximately 292 years (2<sup>63</sup> nanoseconds) will not
 * correctly compute elapsed time due to numerical overflow.
 *
 * <p>The values returned by this method become meaningful only when
 * the difference between two such values, obtained within the same
 * instance of a Java virtual machine, is computed.
 *
 * <p>For example, to measure how long some code takes to execute:
 * <pre> {@code
 * long startTime = System.nanoTime();
 * // ... the code being measured ...
 * long elapsedNanos = System.nanoTime() - startTime;}</pre>
 *
 * <p>To compare elapsed time against a timeout, use <pre> {@code
 * if (System.nanoTime() - startTime >= timeoutNanos) ...}</pre>
 * instead of <pre> {@code
 * if (System.nanoTime() >= startTime + timeoutNanos) ...}</pre>
 * because of the possibility of numerical overflow.
 *
 * @return the current value of the running Java Virtual Machine's
 *         high-resolution time source, in nanoseconds
 * @since 1.5

// 简单说就是：此方法只能用于测量经过的时间，与任何其他系统或壁钟时间概念无关。
// This method can only be used to measure elapsed time and is not related to any other notion of system or wall-clock time.
```

```java
/**
 * Returns the current time in milliseconds.  Note that
 * while the unit of time of the return value is a millisecond,
 * the granularity of the value depends on the underlying
 * operating system and may be larger.  For example, many
 * operating systems measure time in units of tens of
 * milliseconds.
 *
 * <p> See the description of the class {@code Date} for
 * a discussion of slight discrepancies that may arise between
 * "computer time" and coordinated universal time (UTC).
 *
 * @return  the difference, measured in milliseconds, between
 *          the current time and midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.
 * @see     java.util.Date

// 返回当前时间(毫秒)。请注意, 返回值的时间单位为毫秒，值的粒度取决于底层操作系统和可能更大
